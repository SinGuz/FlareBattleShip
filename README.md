# FlareBattleShip
VS2019 used for this solution<br/>
Two projects: console application and the test project<br/>
Everything is (hopefully) self explanatory<br/>
Console application builds the board with three ships (sizes 1, 2 and 6)
and asks users to input attack coordinates.
Number of ships and size in the main program need to be changed programmaticaly<br/>
App does not include looping or user input for board size, number of ships or sizes
because that was not asked for. It would be easy to implement.<br/>
Test project has different tests to verify that the game goes to the end correctly.<br/>
